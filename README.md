### How to get your domain:
- [Fork](https://github.com/is-a-good-dev/register/fork) this repository. 
- Create a new file under the `sub-logs` directory.
  - Name the file according to the sub-domain name that you would like, for example `will.json`

    *The file path and name should look somewhat similar to this: `sub-logs/will.json`*
- Read the format documentation [here](https://docs.is-a-good.dev/format) to see the format you should be following.
- Check over your file to make sure that everything looks right.
- Make your pull request.
- Check up on your pull request. Sometimes we will comment or add a new label, these can mean that you domain is unavailable or something is wrong with the file format. If this is the case, don't worry! You are still able to get a domain, but you may have to either change the file name or check over the file again.
- Leave the rest down to us, we will make sure that the domain is sorted out.
- Once your pull request has been merged, enjoy your subdomain. If you ever need to change the subdomain, don't hesitate to open a new pull request to change any of the details.

### Errors:
Your pull request **will not** be merged if:
